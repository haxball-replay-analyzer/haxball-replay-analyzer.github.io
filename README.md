# Haxball Replay Analyzer
https://haxball-replay-analyzer.github.io

A tool for analyzing haxball recordings (.hbr2). It decrypts Uint8Array files and allow you to check various statistics:  
• scores, kicks, shots on goal, passes, ball possession  
• info about percentage of time the ball was in each third  
• heatmaps for all players  

Analyzer let you switch between all games in single recording, change teamnames (so you can easily create a Match Report), switch between different replay speed (from 0.1x to 10000x).
